# My Portfolio 2019

This is a simple portfolio built with [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) and Vite. It
includes a basic layout with some animated transitions.

## Development

1. Install dependencies
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the development server
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
3. Build for production
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

The app entry point is `index.html` in the project root. Svelte components
live in the `src` directory. Once the dev server is running, visit
<http://localhost:5173/> to view the portfolio.
